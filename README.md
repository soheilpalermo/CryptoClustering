# Cryptocurrency Price Change Analysis and Clustering
## Project Overview
- This project implements an unsupervised machine learning approach to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns across different timeframes. Using Python and various data science libraries, we perform clustering analysis to identify groups of cryptocurrencies that exhibit similar price behavior patterns.

### Features
- Price change analysis across multiple timeframes (24h, 7d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 200d, 1y)
- Data normalization using StandardScaler
- K-means clustering implementation
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction
- Interactive visualizations using hvPlot
- Elbow curve analysis for optimal cluster determination

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- hvPlot for interactive visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for code development and presentation
